How to use
----------

If you plan to make big changes to this website, you better have Jekyll installed locally, so you don't waist time pushing every change to Github or break the actual site.

Steps to install Jekyll on a debian flavored system:

`
sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev
sudo gem install jekyll
sudo gem install jekyll-mentions
`

`jekyll-mentions` is a plugin used to display github usernames as links. Not really necessary, but activated on this website.

Note that Blender-Brussels communication is mainly done in english. But some articles are translated to french. 
The multi-lingual configuration has been inspired by [Sylvain Durand](http://sylvain.durand.tf/making-jekyll-multilingual/).
