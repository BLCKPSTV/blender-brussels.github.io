**Blender-Brussels is pleased to invite Olivier Meunier to give a workshop at iMAL on how to install and play around with the Oculus Rift in Blender.**

The Blender-Brussels is a series of monthly free and open workshops dedicated to Python creative coding using Blender. 
Started by François Zajéga and Julien Deswaef in 2012, these have become a regular meeting point for anyone interested in experimenting with coding in a full featured 3D creation application. 
These workshops are not organized as a regular class room but as a space where the sharing of knowledge and communal exchange of ideas is the way to learn. 
As a result of this practices, all exercises and documentation produced during the workshop are shared online under an open source license.

For this workshop, Blender-Brussels is pleased to invite [Olivier Meunier](http://ogeem.be) to share his experience with the Oculus Rift and Blender. 
Olivier is an experienced Blender user and has already been doing some interior architecture visualization with the Oculus. 
He will guide us through the installation and configuration process needed to make this work on a Gnu/Linux machine. 
We will have 4 Oculus (DK1 & DK2) available and 4 Linux machines for the tests. 

And for the first time, iMAL is opening up its well known workshop space to host this event.

<h3>Program of the day</h3>

**The workshops starts at 10:00 and finishes at 18:00.**

1. Intallation of the necessary components to get an Oculus running on a Gnu/Linux machine and coupled with Blender.
2. Documenting the process, working around the pitfalls and bug reporting if necessary.
3. Playing around with the Oculus, scripting basic Blender scenes to be viewed with it.
 
You are encouraged to bring with you ideas, scripts, Blender scenes and projects that you would like to try out with the Oculus. 
For those who don't have anything, no worries, there is enough examples and scripts done during the previous workshops to modify and play around with. 
Please note that the Blender-Brussels workshop have a policy of publishing under an open source license anything produced during the event. 
So don't bring things that you don't want other participants to put their hands on.
