Usual program for the day (depending also on the participants):
  - **Morning**: Show & Tell. Everyone is invited to present a fonctionnality of BLender so that everyone can learn from everybody. No obligation though, but we have noticed that even the less experienced have something to show that the more experienced will be glad to learn about.
  - **Afternoon**: Hacking time. Experiments around python scripting projects and collaborative work on whatever subject will grab the attendees' attention. In other words, bring your ideas with you. Come with something that could be done in an afternoon or come to help others get their projects done.
