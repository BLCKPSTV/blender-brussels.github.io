**After 3 masterclasses in a row, Blender-Brussels is returning to more usual kind of workshop, exploring together Blender features related to code, from the 9th floor of [F/LAT](http://f-lat.org).**

With the latest developpment of the [Blend4Web](https://www.blend4web.com/) framework, we thought it might be interesting to gather a whole day to explore the different tools and scripts offered by the SDK.  
This could also be an occasion for web developpers and 3D artists to gather around and work on some Javascript and Python code to join both worlds.

As always, this is not a regular class, but more an open space for exploration, with a dedicated theme. So expect discussions, discoveries and knowledge sharing.

**Sounds interesting to you?** Then please send a mail to juego (at) requiem4tv (dot) com to book a seat. 

The Blender-Brussels is a series of monthly free and open workshops dedicated to Python creative coding using Blender. 
Started by [François Zajéga](http://frankiezafe.org) and [Julien Deswaef](http://xuv.be) in 2012, these have become a regular meeting point for anyone interested in experimenting with code. It works as a communal space to exchange ideas and share knowledge as a way to learn. 
All results of these practices − exercises and documentation produced during the workshop − are shared online under an open source license.

This event is hosted at [F/LAT − 45, rue du Canal − 1000 Brussels](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/50.85476/4.34986&layers=N) on Saturday 7th February 2015, **starting at 10:00 and finishing at 18:00**.
