**This workshop is dedicated to exploring generative 3D and mesh modifications using Python scripting.**

For this, we won't start from scratch but will use the [experimental-surface](https://github.com/inconvergent/experimental-surface) script by **Anders Hoff** (@inconvergent) as an object that we will study during the day. 
For those with less python knowledge, we will just experiment by running the script as it is and try to come up with different forms and outcomes. 
For the more advanced Python users, we will take a deeper look at the script inner workings, get inspired by it and integrate some of its concepts into other mesh creation experiments.

The Blender-Brussels is a series of monthly free and open workshops dedicated to Python creative coding using Blender. 
Started by [François Zajéga](http://frankiezafe.org) and [Julien Deswaef](http://xuv.be) in 2012, these have become a regular meeting point for anyone interested in experimenting with code. It works as a communal space to exchange ideas and share knowledge as a way to learn. 
All results of these practices − exercises and documentation produced during the workshop − are shared online under an open source license.

This event is hosted at [F/LAT − 45, rue du Canal − 1000 Brussels](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/50.85476/4.34986&layers=N) on Saturday 28th February 2015, **starting at 10:00 and finishing at 18:00**.
