**An introduction to parametric modeling with the [Sverchok](http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Nodes/Sverchok) addon for Blender**

Sverchok is the russian translation for the word grasshopper. You may have heard of [Grasshopper](http://www.grasshopper3d.com/), the parametric modeling software coupled with Rhino. Well, [Sverchok](http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Nodes/Sverchok), as its name implies, intends to be the free software pendant of Grasshopper for Blender.

Parametric modeling is a technique to build complex 3D geometries using formulas and equations. These techniques have been used in architecture, product design and graphical arts to produce complex shapes that would be too tedious or just impossible to produce by hands.

Here's the Sverchok demo reel to have a glimpse of what is possible:

During this workshop, we intend to go over the basics of installing Sverchok with Blender and starting experimenting with the modelling workflow that it proposes. This will all be done using nodes. So it will also be a great opportunity to learn how to use node interface in Blender.

You might mention that this is not a Python coding workshop per se. And you'd be right. But the approach to this technique is very similar to visual programming as you will be manipulating concepts like variables and functions, while using a graphical interface. This is also an approach found in softwares like Pure-Data or Isadora, for example.   

This workshop will be held at [Arts2, Mons](http://artsaucarre.com/) on **Wednesday 29th April 2015, starting at 14:00 and finishing at 18:00**, during the open doors of the art school. So please pay attention here, it's not in Brussels, and not the usual Saturday. But a great opportunity to visit Mons, discover Arts2 and the work of its students. Everybody welcome. It's a free public event.

**Sounds interesting to you?** Then announce your participation on our [mailing-list](http://lurk.org/groups/blender-brussels/). Just register and say "Hello, I'll be there".

The Blender-Brussels is a series of monthly free and open workshops dedicated to Python creative coding using Blender. 
Started by [François Zajéga](http://frankiezafe.org) and [Julien Deswaef](http://xuv.be) in 2012, these have become a regular meeting point for anyone interested in experimenting with code. It works as a communal space to exchange ideas and share knowledge as a way to learn. 
All results of these practices − exercises and documentation produced during the workshop − are shared online under an open source license.

This event is hosted at [Arts2 − 7000 Mons](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=50.45554%2F3.95296#map=18/50.45554/3.95296) on Wednesday 29th April 2015, **starting at 14:00 and finishing at 18:00**.
