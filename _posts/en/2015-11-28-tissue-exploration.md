**A session focusing on the exploration of the [Tissue addon for Blender](http://www.co-de-it.com/wordpress/code/blender-tissue)**

After a short discussion on our [mailing-list](http://lurk.org/groups/blender-brussels/messages/topic/6lgXxORlPk3LLkwY2WW1Pm/) following a [Blender Nation post](http://www.blendernation.com/2015/10/21/add-on-tissue/) pointing to the new "Tissue" addon by Alessandro Zomparelli, Nebeor pickup the subject and agreed to lead the workshop around the subject.

Nebeor, one of the member of Blender-Brussels, is a developer who likes to use Python to do some experimental modeling inside Blender.

We invite yo to join us in this workshop to explore the possibilities of this computational modeling tool. There is no Python programming involved here (except if you want to dig in the [source code](https://github.com/alessandro-zomparelli/tissue) of the plugin). So it will be mostly manipulations done using the GUI, but we thought it fitted the scope of Blender-Brussels as it has some form of a programmatic approach to designing objects.

Have a look at the presentation video:

And the examples of 3D printed objects generated using Tissue. And tell me you're not impatient to try this

This workshop session will be held this Saturday 28th of November, between 10:45am and 6 pm in the new F/LAT offices. There will be a lunch break 14:00 and 15:00, so you know, in case you want to join at different times.

## Info

The Blender-Brussels is a series of monthly free and open workshops dedicated to Python creative coding using Blender. Started by [François Zajéga](http://frankiezafe.org) and [Julien Deswaef](http://xuv.be) in 2012, these have become a regular meeting point for anyone interested in experimenting with code. It works as a communal space to exchange ideas and share knowledge as a way to learn.

All results of these practices − exercises and documentation produced during the workshop − are shared online under an open source license.

This event is hosted at [F/LAT asbl, 28-30 boulevard Albert II, World-Trade-Center Tower I, 25th floor](http://osm.org/go/0EoTliUnh-?m=) on Saturday 28th November 2015, **starting at 10:45 and finishing at 18:00**.
