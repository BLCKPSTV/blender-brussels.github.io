**A session focusing on the exploration of fractal generation in Blender**

Nebeor, one of the member of Blender-Brussels, has proposed to organise a session around procedural generation and the exploration of fractals. Nebeor is a developper who likes to use Python to do some experimental modeling inside Blender.

[Olm](http://www.ogeem.be/), digital artist and co-founder of F/LAT, will be joining him in this exploration using Sverchock, an addon for Blender facilitating procedural modeling using nodes.

This workshop session will be held this Saturday 6th of June, between 1pm and 6 pm, at F/LAT. So don't hesitate to join us and experiment some fractal blender coding. All levels of expertise are welcome.

If you have a subject of research you'd like to propose to the group, a workshop you wish we would organize, or just want to discuss with a group of Blender enthousiast, don't hesitate to talk to us and/or come organize with us the next event.

**Sounds interesting to you?** Then announce your participation on our [mailing-list](http://lurk.org/groups/blender-brussels/). Just register and say "Hello, I'll be there".

The Blender-Brussels is a series of monthly free and open workshops dedicated to Python creative coding using Blender. Started by [François Zajéga](http://frankiezafe.org) and [Julien Deswaef](http://xuv.be) in 2012, these have become a regular meeting point for anyone interested in experimenting with code. It works as a communal space to exchange ideas and share knowledge as a way to learn.

All results of these practices − exercises and documentation produced during the workshop − are shared online under an open source license.

This event is hosted at [F/LAT − 45, rue du Canal − 1000 Brussels](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/50.85476/4.34986&layers=N) on Saturday 6th June 2015, **starting at 13:00 and finishing at 18:00**.
