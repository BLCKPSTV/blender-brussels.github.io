Announcement posted on [BlenderNation](www.blendernation.com/2012/12/13/blender-workshop-brussels-belgium/#more-31428):

> Julien Deswaef (@xuv) & François Zajéga (@frankiezafe) are organizing a Blender workshop session at ConstantVariable on Friday 21/12/2012, from 09:00 to 17:00, Rue Gallait 80 1030 Schaarbeek Brussels.
> 
> The first session that happened a month ago was about Python scripts and Blender and gathered a few friends interested in this topic. You can have a look of what François has achieved in one day on his website.
> 
> We’ve decided to turn it into a monthly Blender gathering and to open to more people interested in the subject. This is one of the reason why we asked Constantvzw if they could host this project.
> 
> The workshop is not well structured except that it revolves around Blender and python scripting. Some people with more experience than others are invited to share their knowledge, but everybody is welcome with any Blender topic they want to talk about.
> 
> It’s open and free but please confirm your presence by sending a mail to juego [at]requiem4tv [dot]com (Julien) or frankiezafe [at]gmail [dot]com (François).
> 
> Hope to see you there.

> Julien & François
