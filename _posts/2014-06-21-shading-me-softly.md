A shader is piece of code that will calculate rendering effects on the graphic hardware (GPU). They are usually crafted for (but not restricted to) the rendering of a special task like image blur, bump mapping, distortion, bokeh, etc… Being run directly on the graphical processor, they do this with increased speed and can give nice effects to real time animations.

François (@frankiezafe) has been cooking shaders for his own projects and will be your chef for the day. You'll be able to study with him the examples from the [previous shader workshop](../introduction-to-shaders/) and build upon it, or start your own experiments from scratch.

The workshop is free and open to anyone. No previous knowledge of anything is required, just a will to share and learn together. Bring your own laptop.

This event is hosted at [Variable, 80 rue Gallait − Schaerbeek](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/60317745#map=19/50.86677/4.36900) starting at 10:00 and finishing at 18:00.
