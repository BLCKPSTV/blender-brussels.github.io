The theme of this workshop was accidently determined by [this question from Rorts on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1b794f/how_to_create_stream_of_images/):

*« I want to create an effect like [this](https://vimeo.com/45550493). I have a folder that contains thousands of images that I would like to use. How can I make this happen in blender without 99 hours of work? I would assume that a particle system and billboards would be the answer, but I haven't found anything about it yet. »*

The original work is **Zoom from nowhere** by Chris Timms.

To recreate this in Blender, we used an existing addon called "Import images as planes" and hooked that to a particle generator. Then a python script was created to scrape Google images and feed the particle generator with interesting content.
