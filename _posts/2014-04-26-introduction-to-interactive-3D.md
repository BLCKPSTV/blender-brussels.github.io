This workshop is part of the ["Semaine Numérique"](http://lasemainenumerique.be/Introduction-a-la-3D-interactive) series of event and intended for a larger audience. The day will start with a presentation of the different projects developped during the previous sessions. The rest of the day will be dedicated to the basics of Python scripting for interactive 3D in Blender.

During this workshop, François cleaned up a python script he was working on for some time: **a threaded OSC client for the game engine**. As he describes, it removes the problem of OSC messages being lost when game engine is under heavy load. He created some simple .blend demos so anyone could quickly be able to expand on his script.
