By request from [@Ofersmi](https://github.com/ofersmi), we were keen to explore shaders in Blender. Since it's going to take a while to go through the subject, we thought we were going to have at least two sessions around this. This was the first session: "discovering shaders in Blender".


Here is a look at what [@frankiezafe](https://github.com/frankiezafe) had achieved after that day ( plus some after-session homework )

See details of the this experiment on [François Zajega's dedicated page](http://frankiezafe.org/index.php?id=243).


This event was  hosted at [Variable, 80 rue Gallait − Schaerbeek](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/60317745#map=19/50.86677/4.36900) starting at 10:00 and finishing at 18:00.
