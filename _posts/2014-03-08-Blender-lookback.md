The subject of the workshop was "Blender lookback" as inspired or parody of the (in)famous"Facebook lookback". The idea was to work on a series of scripts to automate the creation of movies based on images and videos taken from a folder. Ideally, by changing the content of the folder and re-running
the scripts, we would obtain a "different" movie.

The theme was suggested by Sophie, who hosts a radio show on [Radio Campus](http://www.radiocampus.be). She wants to automate the creation of gifs for each of her readio show based on a folder containing videos and a series of still pictures she draws.

During the workshop, a special python script was cooked and would follow those simple steps:
  # load a video file and scale it (keeping the aspect ratio)
  # load a list of images into the sequencer
  # use them as a mask on a plain color layer
  # launch the video rendering (here configured as a TIFF sequence) 

The series of tiff images was then converted into a .gif with imagemagick.
