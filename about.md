The **Blender-Brussels** also known as **Blender BPY/BGE workshops** is a series of monthly workshops started by [Julien Deswaef](http://xuv.be) and [François Zajéga](http://frankiezafe.org) during the winter of 2012. As a prophecy for the years to come, the first workshop happened in a space called [Variable](http://variable.constantvzw.org) in Brussels, the day the world ended.

The goal is to provide a regular rendez-vous and hacking session for everyone interested in mixing Python scripting in the context of Blender. A theme is usually set up for each session, suggested by the participants or by the organizers themselves. All resulting code and notes are published on this website or the github.

Since march 2014, this event is funded by the [Digital Arts Commission of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation](http://www.arts-numeriques.culture.be/).

The theme of this website is **So Simple Theme** by [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes).
