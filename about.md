The **Blender-Brussels** also known as **Blender BPY/BGE workshops** is a series of monthly workshops created by [Julien Deswaef](http://xuv.be) and [François Zajéga](http://frankiezafe.org) with the aim of providing a monthly gathering and knowledge sharing space for artists and coders interested in Python scripting in the context of Blender. 

The first workshop happened during winter of 2012 in a house called [Variable](http://variable.constantvzw.org) in Brussels, the day the world ended.

All workshops are open to anyone and generally start at 10:00 and finish at 18:00. A theme is usually set up for each session, suggested by the participants or by the organizers themselves. All resulting code and notes are published on this website or on the [github repository](http://github.com/blender-brussels).

These series of workshops are part of the [F/LAT.tmp](http://f-lat.org) program. 

Since march 2014, this event is funded by the [Digital Arts Commission of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation](http://www.arts-numeriques.culture.be/).

We also would like to thank [Constant VZW](http://constantvzw.org/site/) and it's **Libre Video Lab** for graciously providing their space and time.

The theme of this website is **So Simple Theme** by [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes).
